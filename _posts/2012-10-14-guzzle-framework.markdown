This Thursday (October 11, 2012), we had the pleasure of listening to one of our developers, Arturo Contreras talk about his recent experiences building clients with the Guzzle Framework for PHP.  ***"Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client framework that allows developers to consume restful services and build applications that will utilize those web services"*** *(From Arturo's slide. Too perfect, I had to use it)*.

Guzzle has sevaral advantages - it's relatively lightweight, uses the Symfony2 event-based plugin system, and is able to re-try requests.  It also has the capability to send requests in parallel and maintain persistent connections.  It can be installed by composer, or you can include the .phar file into your pfoject. 

Guzzle doesn't just as work as an HTTP client, but can also function as a service client.  By loading in a JSON / XML file, you can give it a map of your API.  

Finally, Arturo dives into how we set up automated testing for our client and any pull requests we make to it using the magic of Github, TravisCI, Mink and Behat.  There's just too much awesomeness in this video to describe in words, and since a video is worth a couple thousands words anyway, we present for your viewing pleasure:
