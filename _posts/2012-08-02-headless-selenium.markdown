Throughout my work here, I ([Allan Chappell](https://github.com/generalredneck)) have made strides revamping the way we use Selenium here at AllPlayers. In doing so, I have started a small project on GitHub for a headless implementation of a [selenium server setup](https://github.com/generalredneck/headless-selenium) that shows some of how developers here at AllPlayers are not only Open Sourcing our efforts in just the Drupal world, but everywhere we can. 

In addition to this, I promote it through [my blog](http://generalredneck.com/blog/headless-selenium). Check it out and feel free to contribute to the efforts of making automated testing easier!
