In this session of AllPlayers.com Eat N Geek, [Travis Tidwell](https://twitter.com/softwaregnome) introduces us to [Express.js](http://expressjs.com), which is a is a minimal and flexible [node.js](http://nodejs.org) web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications. Travis list the reasons and purpose behind choosing express.js, one of which is being able to build an object-oriented web architecture in javascript.  Its also noted that with the help of express.js, it becomes easier for the developer to abstract some of the complexities that arise from node.js while still retaining some of the important features like high concurrency in API calls and asynchronous behavior.
