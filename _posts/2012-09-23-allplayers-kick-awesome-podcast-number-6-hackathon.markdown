I know... I know... Late again... I have a legit reason this time... I promise...

No takers? Fine. Well reguardless, the podcast has been availiable on youtube for a while now. We just haven't gotten around to getting it up here. With that said, *Here at AllPlayers.com, the developers take pride in quality, timeliness, and perfection*...

Still not buying it? Well it was worth another shot.

This last month's podcast was about Hackathons. In particular, ours. We want to set one up and are interested in your input as well. However, we take our best stab at what we think Hackathons *should* be.

While listening to the podcast, you will find out that Max and Chris probably have the most hackathon experiance as we talk about the different hackathons we all have participated, while I sit in the background trying to figure out exactly what it is. He finds that it isn't too terribly far off from the UIL events he used to do in highschool and possibly a shorter version of the ai challenges Google puts on.

Planning is an important part of hackathons. The developers discuss what AllPlayers wants to come out of a successful hackathon. These things are:
 
 * Building innovative/new things during the hackathon
 * Knowledge of how our product API works
 * Knowledge of how other groups want to use our product API
 * Promote quality working apps (Slideshow apps are mentioned several times)

We also talk about tools that are great for hackathons. In particular twitter bootstrap, some sdks we built, and OAuth in general.
