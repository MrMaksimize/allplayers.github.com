As of today I have officially decided I'm a horrible person.  It's so much fun to actually make the podcasts, but then I always slack when it's my turn to upload them.  Either way, this one is timeless.

For our AllPlayers Podcast #7, we have a guest, Erik Baldwin from [CloudNYNEDesign](http://cloudnynedesign.com).  He's a dear friend of mine and I have had the pleasure of working with him on several sites.  I respect him highly as a themer and we decided to pick his brain a little bit on what he thought were the wins and losses of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) vs [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html).  It's a great podcast, so take a listen!
