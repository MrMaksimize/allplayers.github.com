Once again, join the gang as Allan, Chris, James, and Max cover a large spread of multiple topics.

The AllPlayer's team starts using Google Hangout to record the podcast as a video and are really impressed with it's features and all the fun. Unfortunately, the office network died during the picks of the week causing Google to put up the "We are having technical difficulty screen" leaving Max and part of Chris's picks lost in a void. See them below though!

The group goes over briefly the use of Google Drive as a means to store documentation for the company.

Max brings up a passionate subject that gets the whole team debating as Allan tries to play Devil's Advocate for his own personal jollies.

Lastly, James explains PSR1 and PSR2 and the importance of code standards.

Enjoy!
