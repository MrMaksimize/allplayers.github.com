Here at [AllPlayers.com](https://www.allplayers.com/) we have a lot of fun working on **awesome** stuff to *revolutionizing recreational activities*! However, we don't often get to share some of the things we are doing "behind-the-scenes" to enhance the technologies we build on. We *love* open-source and sharing, and we have had many great opportunities at camps and conferences to discuss and talk about what we do. So, in the spirit of learning - here is a quick aggregation of talks and write-ups:

*  [Openca.mp](http://openca.mp)
   *  
*  [Drupal Camp Austin](http://2010.drupalcampaustin.org)
   *  
*  [DrupalCon Chicago](http://chicago2011.drupal.org)
   *  
*  [Lone Star PHP](http://lonestarphp.com)
   *  
*  [Dallas Drupal Days](http://dallasdrupal.org)
   *  
*  [Bay Area Drupal Camp](http://2011.badcamp.net)
   *
